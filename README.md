# Huffman coding

### TO DO
This is a command-line tool for data compression using Huffman's algorithm. The program inputs a text file, determines the frequency of each symbol, constructs a Huffman tree, encodes the text and finally outputs a file containing the compressed text. Alternatively, the program can decompress a file.
