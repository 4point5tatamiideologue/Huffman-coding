# Huffman coding

### TO DO
This is a command-line tool for data compression using Huffman's algorithm. The program inputs a text file, determines relative symbol frequency, constructs a Huffman tree, encodes the data and finally outputs a file containing the compressed data. Alternatively, the program can uncompress a file.
