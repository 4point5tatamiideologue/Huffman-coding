# Huffman coding (work in progress)
This is a command-line tool for data compression using Huffman's algorithm. The program inputs a text file, determines the frequency of each symbol, constructs a Huffman tree, encodes the text and lastly outputs a file containing the compressed text. Alternatively, the program can decompress a file.
